# Sign_Language_Recognition_With_voice-System

**Project Overview**

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.

**Prerequisites**

The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:

Python
IDE (Jupyter)
Numpy
cv2 (openCV)
Keras 
Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing
